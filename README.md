# PlatformOps

Software is no longer delivered in isolation. The days of a manual compile, build, package and deploy are long gone. This shift from manual to automated processes has brought new practices in the world of software development and delivery, mainly around the following 5 points:

1. How software is written?
2. How software projects are structured?
3. How software is packaged and delivered?
4. How software is consumed?
5. How and where software is running?

In essence, the 5 points above define how important **PlatformOps** role is in todayâ€™s world. The role of **PlatformOps** is to help you learn how to put together simple as well as complex software architectures and deliver these in "one-click", or "as code" fashion - reliably, any time of the day.
